**A new class of software is learning to think and act on its own. These "AI agents" promise to reshape how work gets done. Now, OpenAI's Custom GPTs let anyone build a specialized AI assistant. But are these powerful tools true autonomous agents, or simply a clever echo of the real thing? The answer lies in what it means to be independent.**

### What Is an Agent?

This is Bratislava—where the past and future press close. Here, in the heart of an old continent, a new kind of intelligence is taking shape. It is not human. It does not sleep. It is called an AI agent.

An AI agent is a piece of software that sees its world, makes a choice, and then acts. It does this on its own, with a goal in mind and without a person guiding every step. Think of it as a worker with four distinct parts. It has senses to perceive its environment, gathering data through sensors or digital streams. It has a brain to reason and plan, turning information into a sequence of steps. It has memory, both short-term for the task at hand and long-term for lessons learned. And it has hands, or "actuators," to carry out its decisions—sending an email, calling up information, or changing a database. Autonomy is its defining trait.

### The Custom-Built Assistant

Into this world comes a new tool: the Custom GPT. OpenAI, a company in San Francisco, allows anyone to build a tailored version of its ChatGPT. You give it specific instructions. You feed it documents, creating a specialized knowledge base. You can even connect it to the outside world with tools and external data through APIs. No coding is required. A business can create a GPT to answer customer questions from its own manuals. A teacher can build one loaded with textbooks to tutor students.

So, is this Custom GPT a true AI agent? The answer is nuanced. It has some of the parts. The underlying language model provides a powerful reasoning engine. When a user types a prompt, the GPT "perceives" a request. With custom actions, it can "act" on external systems. In this way, it can function as a goal-based agent for a specific, temporary task. If you ask it to find flights and then suggest a packing list, it can plan and execute that sequence.

But the core of true agency is missing. A Custom GPT is not truly autonomous. It is reactive. It waits for a human prompt and then its work stops. It cannot start a task on its own. Its memory is fleeting, unable to learn from interactions across different conversations. It lives inside the walls of ChatGPT, a brilliant specialist confined to its workshop.

Custom GPTs are a significant step. They put the power to configure agent-like tools into many hands. They perform tasks with sharp intelligence. But they are not the independent workers roaming the digital landscape. They are sophisticated instruments that wait for a human conductor to give the signal. The performance is impressive, but the autonomy is not yet there.
