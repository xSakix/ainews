**A new analysis challenges the widespread fear of AI-driven job loss. After reviewing U.S. labor data for the 33 months since ChatGPT’s public launch, researchers found the job market remains remarkably stable, with no evidence of widespread disruption. The findings suggest that, for now, the reality of AI’s impact is far more gradual than the speculation.**

This is Modra—a wine town nestled in the Small Carpathians. The air smells of damp earth and fermenting grapes. Here, as in offices and factories worldwide, a question hangs in the air, potent and unspoken: When will the machines take the jobs?

### A Story of Stability

For nearly three years, since generative artificial intelligence entered the public sphere, anxiety about mass job loss has been widespread. Headlines have stoked fears of an automated wave cresting over the global workforce. But a new, detailed analysis counters speculation with data. The study asks a simple question: Looking at the whole of the U.S. labor market, what has actually happened?

### The answer, so far, is very little.

Researchers found no discernible, economy-wide disruption since ChatGPT’s release. Measures of AI exposure, automation, or augmentation show no clear relationship to changes in employment or unemployment. The story emerging from the data is one of stability, not upheaval.

### History as a Guide

To reach this conclusion, researchers examined the “occupational mix”—the distribution of workers across all jobs in the economy. They measured how quickly this mix is changing now compared to past technological shifts, like the dawn of personal computers in 1984 and the rise of the internet in 1996.

The pace of change today is slightly faster, but not by a large margin. Crucially, the trend of accelerating change began before the widespread introduction of AI, suggesting other forces are at work. Even in the sectors most exposed to AI—Information, Finance, and Business Services—the data shows that significant job shifts were already underway before November 2022.

Widespread technological disruption has always been a story of decades, not months. Computers did not transform offices overnight; it took nearly a decade for them to become common after their public release. The current evidence suggests AI is following a similar, gradual path.

### An Imperfect Picture

Analysts caution that the available data is imperfect. A key challenge is the gap between theoretical “exposure” to AI and actual workplace usage. Data on which jobs could theoretically be impacted does not strongly correlate with data on how the technology is actually being used today. This highlights a need for better, more comprehensive data.

The analysis does not predict the future. It is a snapshot in time. But it provides the best obtainable version of the truth for this moment. The great displacement has not yet begun. The labor market, for now, remains fundamentally stable.
